# Dataset information
The dataset used for this dashboard was found on the website NFLSavant.com, which can be found at the following URL: https://nflsavant.com/about.php

The specific dataset used to create the dashboard and test was the 2024 play by play data, which is the pbp-2024.csv file that was downloaded directly from the website at the link above

For future use, for example with the latest 2025 NFL season, one can download that csv file once it is available and add it to thhis repo. Within the dashboard, there is a sidebar option to select the csv file that should be used within the dashboard. The steps to do this are:
  1. Go to NFLSavant.com URL aboe=ve, download the latest season play-by-play csv
  2. Save the csv to this repo as pbp-yyyy.csv
  3. In the dashboard, update the sidebar dropdown
  4. Redeploy the dashboard
